# Java Object-Oriented Programming – Learning Repository

This repository contains my study notes and practice exercises for the **Java Object-Oriented Programming** course.  
The goal of this project is to build a solid foundation in Java OOP concepts and apply them progressively to real coding exercises and future automation work.

> This repository will be updated continuously as I move through the course.
